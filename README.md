# Azure Resource Manager MCP server

This is a repository to track features, bugs, and suggestions for the Azure Resource Manager MCP server.

## Overview
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the control plane of Azure. Every operation that creates, updates,
or deletes Azure resources flows through ARM, regardless of whether it comes from the Azure portal,
CLI, PowerShell, REST APIs, or SDKs.

AI agents introduce a new kind of Azure client that needs a consistent, centralized way to interact
with ARM. The **Azure Resource Manager MCP server** is designed to provide that access layer through the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), the standard protocol agents use to perform actions and retrieve dynamic
data.

Today, the **Azure Resource Manager MCP server** equips agents with tools to generate, validate, and
execute Azure Resource Graph (ARG) queries, and to deploy and manage ARM templates. The MCP server is able 
to query **all your Azure resource types!**. Its core purpose is to enable both AI agents to interact with 
Azure resources seamlessly, just like other ARM clients. There will be expansion of many more capabilities 
in the future.

## Features
The **Azure Resource Manager MCP server** provides the following key features:
- Generate ARG queries dynamically based on user or agent input.
- Validate ARG queries for correctness and security.
- Execute ARG queries against your Azure environment.
- Deploy ARM templates to Azure.
- Check ARM template deployment status.
- Cancel ARM template deployments in progress.

Below is a table showing the tools provided by the Azure Resource Manager MCP server:

| Tool            | Input                                      | Output                                      | Purpose                                      | Example AI Use Case                         |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| execute_query   | ARG query parameters        | Query results                        | Runs queries and returns results             | Fetching user-requested data                |
| generate_query  | Natural language prompt or requirements     | Generated ARG query        | Creates queries from natural language        | Translating user questions into queries     |
| validate_query  | ARG query                  | Validation result (success/error message)   | Checks queries for correctness and safety    | Ensuring queries are valid before execution |
| create_template_deployment  | Subscription ID, resource group, deployment name, ARM template definition | Deployment initiation response | Starts an ARM template deployment in a target resource group | Deploying infrastructure requested by a user |
| get_arm_template_deployment_status  | Subscription ID, resource group, deployment name | Current deployment status and details | Monitors deployment progress and outcome | Checking whether a deployment succeeded or failed |
| cancel_arm_template_deployment  | Subscription ID, resource group, deployment name | Cancellation result | Stops an in-progress ARM template deployment | Halting a deployment after validation or policy concerns |

### Cost Management & Pricing tools

Several Cost Management & Pricing tools are **enabled by default** and need no
extra configuration — `query_costs`, `query_aks_costs`, `get_retail_prices`,
`start_pricesheet_download`, and `get_pricesheet_status`. They let agents answer
questions like *"What did I spend on Azure this month, broken down by service?"*
or *"How much would a Standard_E4s_v5 VM cost in East US?"*

The remaining Cost Management tools — cost forecasting, dimensions, budgets,
alerts, and reservation/savings-plan insights — ship as an optional
**Cost Management** toolset you can turn on per client with the
`x-mcp-toolset: CostManagement` header.

See [Cost Management & Pricing tools](./docs/CostManagementAndPricingTools.md)
for the full tool list, setup, and example prompts.

## Supported Clients
During this preview, Azure Resource Manager MCP server can only be used with a set of MCP Clients. Right now you can use:
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**

Support for additional clients will be added based on user feedback and demand. If you have a
specific client you'd like to see supported, please open an issue to let us know!

### Other client support

For 3rd-party client setup details (app registration, manifest permissions, redirect URI, service principal
creation, and connector configuration), see [Other client support](./docs/OtherClientSupport.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- VS Code installed 
- Valid Azure Account
- GitHub Copilot account 

### Installation

#### 1. Installing the MCP Server
1. Open: **https://aka.ms/JoinARMMCP**. VS Code will launch automatically. 

2. When prompted inside VS Code, click **Install** under **Azure Resource Manager MCP server** to add it to your MCP server configuration.

3. You will be prompted to sign in with your Azure credentials. 

#### 2. Open the Chat Interface
1. In VS Code, go to **View > Chat**, or click the chat icon to the right of the center toolbar
   header.
2. In the Chat window, click the **Configure Tools** icon.  
3. Ensure **Azure Resource Manager MCP server** is checked. You can click the dropdown icon to see the available tools under
   it:
  - **execute_query**   
  - **generate_query**  
  - **validate_query**
  - **create_template_deployment**
  - **get_arm_template_deployment_status**
  - **cancel_arm_template_deployment**

## Usage

1. Open the Chat interface in VS Code.
2. Ensure the Azure Resource Manager MCP server tools are enabled.
3. Type your query or request in natural language.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/Troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions when
using the Azure Resource Manager MCP server. For additional questions and answers, refer to the
[FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md).

## Governance

The Azure Resource Manager MCP server uses the same authentication and authorization context as the
signed-in user in VS Code. This means that all tool calls are made on behalf of that user and are
subject to the same permissions and access controls defined in Azure.

### Blocking Template requests
To prevent any deployments from being made via the ARM MCP server you can apply an Azure Policy to
the relevant scope (subscription or resource group) that denies request the deployment tool
(`create_template_deployment`). To see an example of such a policy, please refer to [this sample
policy](./docs/BlockingDeploymentsPolicy.json). You will need to specifically block the AppID of the
MCP server, which is `22bfbae3-f4e7-485f-be43-8cee15065084`.
